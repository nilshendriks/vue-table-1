# Dynamic Vue Table

## Overview

This project demonstrates the construction of a dynamic Vue table using Vue.js and its Composition API. The table component offers sorting, searching, and pagination capabilities to enhance the user experience of data-driven web applications.

## Key Features

- **Sorting:** Clickable column headers enable users to sort table data in ascending or descending order, providing flexibility in data exploration.

- **Searching:** The table includes a search input field that dynamically filters table rows based on user input, facilitating efficient data discovery within large datasets.

- **Pagination:** Basic pagination functionality divides large datasets into manageable chunks, allowing users to navigate through pages of data with ease.

## Implementation Details

- **Vue 3 Composition API:** The component's state and behavior are managed using Vue 3's Composition API, ensuring a clean and efficient codebase.

- **Axios:** Data retrieval is handled using Axios, a popular HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, to fetch data from a mock API.

- **Moment.js:** For date formatting, Moment.js is utilized to ensure dates are presented accurately and intuitively to users.
